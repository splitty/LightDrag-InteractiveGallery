# LightDrag-InteractiveGallery
 Real time computer vision image gallery for scrolling through images using webcam and leds.

### What does it do?

LightDrag is the start of a possibly larger project involving the creation of a more interactive method of showcasing images in a gallery setting.  Instead of the typical photo paper and frame, I wanted to begin thinking about having the viewer be in control of the gallery themselves, either choosing to spend more time on an image, or perhaps just swiping past.  

The action of swiping was both an easy to code method of gesture detection using the x-axis and also a distinctly familiar gesture in and of itself.  In the age of smartphones and digital devices displaying everything we want to see, all of which under our control, I took an interest in recreating that feeling of digital control and reminiscence to the gallery.

### PowerGlove

For the interaction between viewer and display, I needed something that felt easy to pick up and have an idea of what to do with it.  Hence, the LED PowerGlove.  The PowerGlove is currently a prototype that uses the pinching together of the thumb and pointer finger to turn on the LED which is then detected by the webcam.  From there, it's a simple pinch and drag to swipe through the images on the display.  By having the ability to physically feel like you're impacting the display through the PowerGlove, I hope to create a more visceral and connected viewing experience.
